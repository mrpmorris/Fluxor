## Introduction
If you are new to Fluxor, or to the Flux/Redux approach in general then [this YouTube video by Nick Chapsas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_c-ErPaYa8) is an excellent introduction.
The video is based on the original [Blazor-Fluxor](https://github.com/mrpmorris/blazor-fluxor) library, but the concepts are the same.

## Goal
The aim of Fluxor is to create a multi-UI, single-state store approach to front-end development without the headaches typically associated with other implementations, such as the overwhelming amount of boiler-plate code required just to add a very basic feature.

## Getting started
The easiest way to get started is to read the [documentation](./Docs/README.md).
Which includes tutorials that are numbered in an order recommended for learning Fluxor. Each will have a `README` file that explains how the tutorial was created.

There is also [this great introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAyH-O0dFaI) by [Chris Clement](https://twitter.com/christo_ment)
