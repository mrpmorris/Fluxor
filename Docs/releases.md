# Releases

### New in 4.0
 * Added support for automatically including middlewares.

By adding the attribute `[AutomaticallyIncludeMiddleware]` to a Middlware, Fluxor
will automatically include it in the store rather than having to manually
adding it like so.

```c#
services.AddFluxor(x => x
	.ScanAssemblies(GetType().Assembly)
	.AddMiddleware<MyMiddleware>());
```


### New in 3.9
 * Support added for .NET 5.0

### New in 3.8
 * Allow state notification throttling to reduce time spent rendering ([#114](https://github.com/mrpmorris/Fluxor/issues/114)) - see:
   *  `FluxorComponent.MaximumStateChangedNotificationsPerSecond`
   *  `FluxorLayout.MaximumStateChangedNotificationsPerSecond`
   *  `Feature.MaximumStateChangedNotificationsPerSecond`
 * Fix for ([#105](https://github.com/mrpmorris/Fluxor/issues/105)) - 
     Allow FluxorComponent descendents to dispatch actions when overriding `Dispose(bool)`.
 * Added an optional `actionType` to `[EffectMethod]` to avoid compiler warnings when the action is not used

```c#
public class SomeEffects
{
  [EffectMethod(typeof(RefreshDataAction))]
  public Task CallItWhateverYouLike(IDispatcher dispatcher)
  {
    ... code here ...
  }

  // is equivalent to

  [EffectMethod]
  public Task CallItWhateverYouLike(RefreshDataAction unusedParameter, IDispatcher dispatcher)
  {
    ... code here ...
  }
}
```

 * Added an optional `actionType` to `[ReducerMethod]` to avoid compiler warnings when the action is not used

```c#
public class SomeReducers
{
  [ReducerMethod(typeof(IncrementCounterAction))]
  public MyState CallItWhateverYouLike(MyState state) =>
    new MyState(state.Count + 1);

  // is equivalent to

  [ReducerMethod]
  public MyState CallItWhateverYouLike(MyState state, IncrementCounterAction unusedParameter) =>
    new MyState(state.Count + 1);
}
```

 * Added support for declaring `[ReducerMethod]` on generic classes

```c#
public class TestIntReducer: AbstractGenericStateReducers<int>
{
}

public class TestStringReducer: AbstractGenericStateReducers<string>
{
}

public abstract class AbstractGenericStateReducers<T>
	where T : IEquatable<T>
{
	[ReducerMethod]
	public static TestState<T> ReduceRemoveItemAction(TestState<T> state, RemoveItemAction<T> action) =>
		new TestState<T>(state.Items.Where(x => !x.Equals(action.Item)).ToArray());
}
```

 * Added support for declaring `[EffectMethod]` on generic classes

```c#
public class GenericEffectClassForMyAction : AbstractGenericEffectClass<MyAction>
{
	public GenericEffectClassForMyAction(SomeService someService) : base(someService)
	{
	}
}

public class GenericEffectClassForAnotherAction : AbstractGenericEffectClass<AnotherAction>
{
	public GenericEffectClassForAnotherAction(SomeService someService) : base(someService)
	{
	}
}

public abstract class AbstractGenericEffectClass<T> 
{
	private readonly ISomeService SomeService;

	protected AbstractGenericEffectClass(ISomeService someService)
	{
		SomeService = someService;
	}

	[EffectMethod]
	public Task HandleTheActionAsync(T action, IDispatcher dispatcher)
	{
		return SomeService.DoSomethingAsync(action);
	}
}
```

### New in 3.7
 * Fix for ([#84](https://github.com/mrpmorris/Fluxor/issues/84) - 
   Allow observer to unsubscribe from all subscriptions whilst executing
   the callback from a previous subscription
 * Fix for ([#82](https://github.com/mrpmorris/Fluxor/issues/82)) -
   Throw an informative exception when `FluxorComponent` or `FluxorLayout`
   has been inherited and the descendant doesn't call `base.OnInitialized()`.
 * Fix for ([#77](https://github.com/mrpmorris/Fluxor/issues/87)) -
   Exception thrown initialising store in .NET 5.

### New in 3.6
 * Ensure synchronous effects are executed synchronously ([#76](https://github.com/mrpmorris/fluxor/issues/76)) -
   Reverts changes for [(#74) Endless loop redirects](https://github.com/mrpmorris/Fluxor/issues/74) as
   these are no longer occur.

### New in 3.5
 * Bug fix for ([#74](https://github.com/mrpmorris/Fluxor/issues/74)) - Handle endless loop redirects caused by Routing middleware.

 * New `IActionSubscriber` to receive notifications before actions are reduced into state and before Effects are triggered
 * More speed improvements in `options.ScanAssemblies`

 * State properties were not discovered if they were declared as private in a base class ([#25](https://github.com/mrpmorris/Fluxor/issues/25))
 * Handle disposing of partially created DisposableAction ([#29](https://github.com/mrpmorris/Fluxor/issues/29))

### New in 3.1.0
  * Used Newtonsoft entirely for JS interop to ReduxDevTools to prevent serialization errors ([#7](https://github.com/mrpmorris/Fluxor/issues/7))
